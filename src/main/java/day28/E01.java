        1) Exception is un-expected issue.
        2) There are 2 ways to work with Exceptions;
             i) Throw Exception ==> Ask help
             ii) Handle Exception ==> Do it by yourself without asking help
        3) Mainly there are 2 types of Exceptions;
             i) Runtime Exceptions ==> We will see them after clicking on "run" button
             ii) Compile Time Exception ==> We will see them while we type our code
